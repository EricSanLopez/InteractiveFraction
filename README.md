# InteractiveFraction
A simple GUI created with Python to plot piechart as fractions. 
Used to introduce kids to the concept of fractions.

The top input rectangle corresponds to the numerator and the bottom input to the denominator.
When clicking the "Ok" button the new fraction plots. 
The button "EXPLOSIVE" separates every part of the fraction in order to improve the visualization and better understanding.

Finally the "Quit" button closes the program.
